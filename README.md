# AI-Assignment5

I have used python3 programming language to work on this assignment. Used the inbuilt libraries like Numpy, sklearn kit and matplotlib.
The task of this assignment is to design a pattern recognition neural network to recognize hand written digits given a large dataset of digits in a 32 * 32 Boolean format. 
To construct a machine learning model, the first task is to find the features that determine each digit.
Looking at the digits, we can say that each individual digit can be seen as a pixel each of which contributes to the final result that comes out of the model.

### How to compile and execute

I have saved the Google colab copy, it takes the Zipfile input and uncompress it and then I have written the program to consider the data part in the text file named datafile.txt. The data will be divided into train and test data accordingly using neural network.

I have written two Python programs. One is for pattern recognition and used the neural network in sklearn library. Trained the neural network (pattern net) based on the input/output files. The other program is to understand the Dimension reduction Using 1024 features for neural network is very cumbersome. To study how to effective will the program work if I reduce the number of features. Both the programs considers the input file that has been already provided in the assignment and parses the sudoku data file.

I have used Anaconda Navigator JupiterLab to work on this assignment. This program can also be executed in Google Colab.
